1. How do I approach designing software?
   - What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
      - The skills to apply mathmatical formulas to generate deisigns.  This skill could be taken to frontend web development where there are many objects, animations, and patterns that could benefit from being a mathmatical formula.
   - What design process did you follow for your project work?
      - I followed the design process of best practices.  This include making my code readable and self documenting while adding comments where nessessary. 
   - How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
      - All my future work will need to have readable code that follows best practices.  Then my future work can also always benefit from being condensed into a mathmatical formula. 
2. How do I approach developing programs?
   - What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
      - I used development strategies to get the job done.  I rewatched many webinars and applied the lessons being taunt to my own project.
   - How did iteration factor into your development?
      - Every step of the way there was iteration.  We started with a cube and moved forward with the cube adding lighting and texture.  I had to do the same with my own shapes as drawing them was more complex than the cube.
   - How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
      - My approached evolved through the use of best pratices.  I tried to self document my code as much as possible but added in manual comments when I though it was needed.
3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
   - How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
      - Understanding how graphics work is essential to everything we will build.  OpenGL is used in desktop, mobile, and web applications.  Humans will always need an interface with nice graphics to interact with a program.
